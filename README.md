# TypeScript: Union and Intersection Types and Their Impact on Code Quality

This document provides two informational sections: Blog 1, which demonstrates the use of union and intersection types in TypeScript with practical examples, and Blog 2, which explains how TypeScript enhances code quality and project maintainability.

## Blog 1: Using Union and Intersection Types in TypeScript

TypeScript's union and intersection types enable developers to define precise and flexible type structures, improving code reliability. Below are examples illustrating their usage.

### Union Types
Union types allow a value to be one of multiple types, denoted by the `|` operator. They are useful for restricting values to a specific set of options.

```typescript
type Status = 'success' | 'error' | 'loading';

function handleStatus(status: Status): void {
  switch (status) {
    case 'success':
      console.log('Operation completed successfully.');
      break;
    case 'error':
      console.log('An error occurred.');
      break;
    case 'loading':
      console.log('Processing...');
      break;
  }
}

handleStatus('success'); // Output: Operation completed successfully.
handleStatus('error');  // Output: An error occurred.
// handleStatus('invalid'); // Error: Argument of type '"invalid"' is not assignable to parameter of type 'Status'.
```

In this example, the `Status` type restricts the `status` parameter to `'success'`, `'error'`, or `'loading'`. TypeScript's compiler ensures only valid values are used, preventing runtime errors.

### Intersection Types
Intersection types combine multiple types into a single type using the `&` operator, requiring an object to satisfy all properties of the combined types.

```typescript
interface User {
  name: string;
  email: string;
}

interface Admin {
  permissions: string[];
}

type AdminUser = User & Admin;

const admin: AdminUser = {
  name: 'Alice',
  email: 'alice@example.com',
  permissions: ['read', 'write', 'delete'],
};

console.log(`${admin.name} has permissions: ${admin.permissions.join(', ')}`);
// Output: Alice has permissions: read, write, delete
```

The `AdminUser` type requires properties from both `User` and `Admin`. TypeScript enforces this structure, ensuring all necessary fields are present.

## Blog 2: How TypeScript Enhances Code Quality and Project Maintainability

TypeScript significantly improves code quality and maintainability, making it a valuable tool for modern software development. Below are key ways it achieves this.

1. **Type Safety**: TypeScript's static type checking identifies errors during development, such as passing incorrect data types or accessing undefined properties. This reduces runtime errors and enhances code reliability.

2. **Facilitated Refactoring**: Type annotations define clear interfaces, allowing developers to refactor code confidently. For instance, renaming a variable or modifying a function signature triggers compiler errors if inconsistencies arise, ensuring safe changes.

3. **Enhanced Code Readability**: Types serve as inline documentation, clarifying the purpose and structure of code. A function signature like `getUser(id: number): User` immediately communicates its input and output, streamlining collaboration and onboarding.

4. **Scalability for Large Projects**: In complex or team-based projects, TypeScriptâ€™s type system enforces consistency, preventing issues like mismatched data structures. This is critical as codebases grow or team members change.

5. **Advanced Tooling**: TypeScript integrates with IDEs to provide features like autocompletion, type hints, and real-time error detection. These tools accelerate development and reduce manual errors.

For example, in a project handling user data, TypeScript ensures that objects passed to functions contain all required fields, catching potential issues during compilation rather than at runtime. This proactive error detection saves debugging time and improves software stability.

By enforcing type safety, improving readability, and supporting robust tooling, TypeScript empowers developers to build maintainable, high-quality codebases, particularly in large-scale or collaborative environments.
