# TypeScript: Union and Intersection Types and Their Impact on Code Quality


## Blog 1: Using Union and Intersection Types in TypeScript

TypeScript's union and intersection types enable developers to define precise and flexible type structures, improving code reliability. Below are examples illustrating their usage.

### Union Types
Union types allow a value to be one of multiple types, denoted by the `|` operator. They are useful for restricting values to a specific set of options.

```typescript
type Status = 'success' | 'error' | 'loading';

function handleStatus(status: Status): void {
  switch (status) {
    case 'success':
      console.log('Operation completed successfully.');
      break;
    case 'error':
      console.log('An error occurred.');
      break;
    case 'loading':
      console.log('Processing...');
      break;
  }
}

handleStatus('success'); // Output: Operation completed successfully.
handleStatus('error');  // Output: An error occurred.
// handleStatus('invalid'); // Error: Argument of type '"invalid"' is not assignable to parameter of type 'Status'.
```



### Intersection Types
Intersection types combine multiple types into a single type using the `&` operator, requiring an object to satisfy all properties of the combined types.

```typescript
interface User {
  name: string;
  email: string;
}

interface Admin {
  permissions: string[];
}

type AdminUser = User & Admin;

const admin: AdminUser = {
  name: 'Alice',
  email: 'alice@example.com',
  permissions: ['read', 'write', 'delete'],
};

console.log(`${admin.name} has permissions: ${admin.permissions.join(', ')}`);
// Output: Alice has permissions: read, write, delete
```



## Blog 2: How TypeScript Enhances Code Quality and Project Maintainability

TypeScript significantly improves code quality and maintainability, making it a valuable tool for modern software development. Below are key ways it achieves this.

1. **Type Safety**: TypeScript's static type checking identifies errors during development, such as passing incorrect data types or accessing undefined properties. This reduces runtime errors and enhances code reliability.

2. **Facilitated Refactoring**: Type annotations define clear interfaces, allowing developers to refactor code confidently. For instance, renaming a variable or modifying a function signature triggers compiler errors if inconsistencies arise, ensuring safe changes.

3. **Enhanced Code Readability**: Types serve as inline documentation, clarifying the purpose and structure of code. A function signature like `getUser(id: number): User` immediately communicates its input and output, streamlining collaboration and onboarding.

4. **Scalability for Large Projects**: In complex or team-based projects, TypeScriptâ€™s type system enforces consistency, preventing issues like mismatched data structures. This is critical as codebases grow or team members change.

5. **Advanced Tooling**: TypeScript integrates with IDEs to provide features like autocompletion, type hints, and real-time error detection. These tools accelerate development and reduce manual errors.
